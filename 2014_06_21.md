B. Front-end Structure
--------

- Grades: Table View - columns are grades, rows are students. 
Each cell contains two items: View (Opens the assignment in a new tab.) Score (If the student did not submit an assignment, the score is automatically zero.)
There are two columns by default - attendance and total score. The total score is calculated by subtracting the points lost from 100. For example, if the student received 3 / 5 on HW1, 2 points will be deducted from 100.

- Resources: Divided into three sections - Lectures, Assignments, and Handson.
An instructor will simply upload the resource in a single file - PDF for lectures and ZIP for Assignments & Handson.
A student will submit an assignment file-by-file: HTML, CSS, JS, and Static (Zipped.) For some assignments, students will only need to submit CSS (or HTML / JS)

- Attendance: On the student side, there are two sections - submit an absence request and do a check-in. On the instructor side, there's only one section - see absence request.
If the student did not do a check-in, points will be automatically deducted from the Grades. An instructor can view an absence request and either approve or reject.
