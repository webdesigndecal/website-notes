    project (not final project) to the site and see their work rendered as webpages.
    
    - Sending Messages: Students should be able to send messages to the instructor with
    tags like "question," "homework", "absence", etc.
    
    - Marking Attendance: Students should be able to mark their attendance and check how
    much days of class they have missed.
    
    - Viewing Materials: Students should be able to view and download lecture slides,
    homework assignments, lab hands-on activities, etc.
    
- Instructor Dashboard (front-end, back-end teams)

    student and update these grades.

    slides, homework assignments, lab hands-on activities, etc.


D. Back-end Structure
--------

The back-end of this website will be built in [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). To
standardize all developer environments, please use [version 1.6](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/)
with [Python 2.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are not sure of how to set
up the Django environment, refer to this [installation guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/install/).

It does not matter what database you use for development. The default sqlite database should
be fine. Note that the production database will be MySQL (though this could change in the future).

Django works with models and views. Models are Python objects, and views are functions that
query the database for model instances, properties, and methods. Data points are instances
of models, and views help populate webpages dynamically using the powerful Django templates.

We will probably be building models that inherit from the [Django User model](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/auth/).
Most likely, we should build the `Student` and `Instructor` models to both inherit from
the `User` model.

Each of the five following features (with different functions for students and instructors)
will be built using a separate Django app:

1. Grading
2. Materials
3. Assignments
4. Communication
5. Attendance

These five apps will populate different views for students versus instructors and help us
achieve the goals detailed above.
